# 🧠 MultiQuiz App

MultiQuiz is an Android quiz application built using **Kotlin**, **Android Jetpack ViewModel**, and **MVVM Architecture**. This app allows users to answer multiple-choice questions with hint options, tracks scores, and ensures persistence across screen rotations.

## 📜 Overview

The MultiQuiz App is developed in **three phases**, iteratively improving upon functionality:

- **Part 1:** Basic multiple-choice quiz with a single question and answer options.
- **Part 2:** Enhancements including multiple questions, improved hint functionality, and device rotation support.
- **Part 3:** Score tracking and UI updates to display user performance.

The project closely follows **BNRG Chapters 2–8** to ensure best practices in Android development.
